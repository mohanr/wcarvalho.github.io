<!-- I interested in understanding behavior and cognition from a computational, algorithmic, and physical perspective. This manifests as research interests ranging from computational models for behavior based on Bayesian nonparametrics to modeling how we learn useful feature representations using deep reinforcement learning. I hope to use my research on the brain to combat societal issues like social stereotyping. -->

<!-- My primary research interest is in uncovering the brain's algorithms. More specifically, I want to research how behavior and cognition are manifestations of the brainâ€™s learning algorithms and to emulate these algorithms using a machine learning framework.  -->
