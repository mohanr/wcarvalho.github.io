My name is Wilka Torrico De Carvalho and I am an Afro-Latino, socially sensitive, aspiring brain and machine learning scientist. I am currently an <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF graduate research fellow in neuroscience</a> exploring principled methods of analyzing the mind and brain. Among those which excite me most are 
<ol>
  <li>
     <a href="http://gershmanlab.webfactional.com/pubs/GershmanBlei12.pdf">Bayesian nonparametric methods</a> for its ability to specify methods by which humans might define (potentially) infinite hidden variables in response to observed data and 
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~nivlab/papers/NivLangdon2016.pdf">reinforcement learning</a> for its ability to elucidate how humans place value on what they encounter in order to optimize their experience.
  </li>
</ol>
My long term goal is to develop theoretical models for cognition and behavior that I may corroborate through experimental work with humans  and through AI-based computer simulations.

As a member of underrepresented groups in research and academia, outreach is important to me. I encourage all young scholars (especially those from marginalized backgrounds) to reach out to me with any questions. Relevant topics include pursuing computational methods of studying the mind and brain, applying for fellowships, and graduate school.
