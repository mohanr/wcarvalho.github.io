If you are a young scholar looking for advice on pursuing research or applying for fellowships, please feel free to reach out to me for advice! Likewise for advice exploring the fields of machine learning, computational cognitive science, or computational neuroscience (or any intersection). This is especially true for those that come from marginalized groups--especially those that are Black and Hispanic!
