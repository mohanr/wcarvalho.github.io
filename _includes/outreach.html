If you are a young scholar looking for advice on pursuing research, applying for fellowships, or entering the fields of machine learning, computational cognitive science, or computational neuroscience (or any intersection), please feel free to reach out to me for advice! This is especially true for those that come from marginalized groups--especially those that are Black and Hispanic!
