### Birth of Interests
I spent the first 6 years of my life in Bolivia, living with local indigenous groups as my mother conducted ethnography research. Afterwards, we moved to New York City (NYC). Because of the physical and cultural differences between my peers and me, I experienced social exlcusion. Combined with my parent's constant emphasis on understanding people's thoughts and behaviors as a result of their environment(s) and experiences, I became interested in the basis for people's behavior and how an "individual" is created. Ultimately, this became an interest in how the mind is able to efficiently and effectively parse massive amounts of information and produce our intelligent behavior.

### Development
While in NYC, I was fortunate to attend [Brooklyn Technical High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Technical_High_School), where, through the applied physics major, I discovered my disposition towards analytic and axiomatic reasoning. 

Afterwards, I attended <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/">Stony Brook University</a> for my undergrad, where I decided to pursue a physics major in order to pursue theoretical neuroscience. Inspired by [Christof Koch's](http://www.klab.caltech.edu/koch/) reductionist approach, I hoped to do research reducing the biophysical mechanisms within the brain into manifestations of information processing. 

After exploring research projects in neural engineering, cognitive neuroscience, and computational neuroscience, I realized that my interest was in what algorithms the brain uses to parse information. I won the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](http://sb.cc.stonybrook.edu/happenings/student-spotlight/2015-nsf-graduate-research-fellow-wilka-carvalho/) in Neuroscience, which I used to pursue a masters in computer science at the [University of Southern California](http://www.usc.edu), with the intention of combining artificial intelligence, machine learning, neuroscience, and cognitive science (among others) to uncover the brain's algorithms.

### Current
At this point in life, the following questions are  recurrent themes in my thoughts, 

1. "how does the brain use populations of neurons to both parse and represent information?"
3. If control is decentralized, is it at the neuronal network level or or the neuron level? 
3. What algorithms allow decentralized information-processing to culminate into a capable - and seemingly singular - autonomous agent?

I intend to explore these questions by following work in fields like neuroscience and cognitive science, and using this knowledge to find or discover general learning and information-processing algorithms plausible for the brain. 
Ideally I will test hypothesis by building and studying models that incorporate reinforcement learning, neural networks, and graphs to store and a parse information.

This interest manifests in many fields. Besides those mentioned, others include:
* Knowledge representation
* Unsupervised learning
* Natural language processing
* Computer vision
