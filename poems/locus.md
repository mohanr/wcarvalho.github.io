title: Our Loci
---

A mini exploration into how vantage points effect our perspectives. Here, I admit how limiting my perspective is  despite how strongly it impacts my perception of the world I experience and my place in it.

A wandering man once came up to me and asked
"What is the locus of your person?"

I responded, "Why, my eyes, of course."
