title: Our Loci
---

This is a mini exploration into the vantage point of our perspectives, both showcasing how limiting they can be and how strongly they impact the world we percieve. 

### Dialogue

Man 1: A wandering man once came up to me and asked
"What is the locus of your person?"

Man 2: I responded, "Why, my eyes, of course."
