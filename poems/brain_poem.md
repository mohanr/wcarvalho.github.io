Every shock<br>
Every surge<br>
Every shoot<br>
Is a dance<br>

A light show in darkness<br>

And I want to watch<br>
I want to learn

Not mimic your movements<br>
Just understand them<br>
Please let me understand them<br>

How do you transition?<br>
When do you switch partners?<br>
When do you switch lanes?<br>
And the rhythm

It escapes me<br>

Escapes all of us<br>
Try as we have, we have never understood<br>

Some say you follow Ohm's law.<br>
But that is as much a full answer as Newton's was<br>

A fourth of all movement covered?<br>
If only ohm's covered so much<br>

Then I could follow<br>
Then I could learn<br>

Don't worry<br>
I know you're not selfish<br>
This dance is for us<br>
To provide us function<br>

So just keep on dancing<br>
Keep on dancing for us<br>

And we will use science<br>
That is its beauty.<br>
That is its point:<br>
A forever expanding bridge<br>

Sure Newton's laws left gaps,<br>
But just as they're being filled<br>
Ohm's will be as well <br>

And science will allow us to learn<br>
Allow us to follow this dance<br>
And understand your beautiful rhythm<br>
