The perfect world for me is not the same as for those around me<br>
I do not associate light with a source of warmth<br>
It provides me no comfort<br>
Light just allows for exposure<br>
Maximize light. Maximize exposure.<br>
Everything becomes clear. Vivid. Alive.<br>
<br>
Too much. It blinds me and allows for nothing to be seen.<br>
Not clearly at least.<br>
I can make out shapes. Fuzzy lines.<br>
Obstructed figures.<br>
But I see nothing clearly.<br>
<br>
I can only focus one pair at a time<br>
This much light, means this much focus given to one.<br>
So the other is left with nothing.<br>
Blind. <br>
<br>
And I hate this blind state.<br>
No, to me warmth comes from the absence of light.<br>
That is my source of comfort.<br>
Minimize light. Minimize exposure. Comfortable.<br>
Everything becomes clear. <br>
<br>
Not too much. Actually a perfect amount of too little.<br>
It takes only a few moments for my eyes to adjust.<br>
I put no effort in and I can see.<br>
So the other is left with everything.<br>
And how clearly I can see.<br>
Now this is comfort. This is warmth. This is wonderful.<br>
A world without light, means a world with good vision.<br>
Well for me at least.<br>
<br>
So now I journey to find this world.<br>
Where I can see clearly and find warmth.<br>
<br>
I hope only that when I arrive<br>
I can find a way to stop time.<br>

And just sit there.
