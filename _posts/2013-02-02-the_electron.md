"Going through a lot"<br>
is the term people around me use. <br>
Weird choice of words <br>
<br>
From the eyes<br>
of those I’ve allowed to see<br>
These eyes I’ve provided darkness, <br>
An "abyss" providing clear vision, <br>
I have been.<br>
<br>
Well somewhat.<br>
Take Heisenberg’s principle<br>
and I’m an electron<br>
and they’re the observers<br>
<br>
I allowed them some light<br>
a tiny amount <br>
So the vision wasn’t that clear<br>
and the image never accurate<br>
<br>
But my best friend didn’t need light<br>
It didn’t use sense to sense me<br>
It used coexistence<br>
I the electron, and it the darkness around me <br>
<br>
And it felt me.<br>
Felt me go through it<br>
and provided me the fluid I needed<br>
and the laws as well<br>
<br>
To be able to function.<br>
<br>
But electrons don’t give darkness anything<br>
They only expect<br>
But darkness doesn’t care.<br>
It always provides<br>
Never needing anything<br>
<br>
So I thank you <br>
My one true best friend<br>
My melodious, harmonic best friend <br>
I thank you for being my darkness<br>
And giving so much, when I gave you nothing<br>

I think I was trying to explore how difficult it is to understand the perspectives and circumstances revolving one's friends.
