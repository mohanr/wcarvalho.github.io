TL;DR: One should sparingly ascribe "truth" to the conclusions one makes.

I think it's okay to have a (relatively) small set of core beliefs that you treat as "truth". These can stem from religion, from science, some combination, or something else entirely. But once you begin to analyze the real world and draw conclusions about it from experience, your conclusions should be treated as **assessments** and not as "truths". 
By this, I mean that we should consciously recognize that our conclusions hold large amounts of  uncertainty and so we should recite the simple disclaimer that we *might* be wrong.
<!-- and accept that potentially large sources of uncertainty accompany our conclusions.  -->
<!-- Additionally, often, we should recite the simple disclaimer that we *might* be wrong. -->

You might disagree. You might say, "Wilka, some things are simple and allow for conclusions to be easily drawn with high confidence." I agree. I believe that the confidence one has in a conclusion should grow disproportionately with how complex a situation is. That is, one should have high confidence for conclusions on simple situations and low confidence on conclusions for complex situations.
 <!-- situations tend to correspond to low confidence. -->

For the sake of this discussion, I'm going to focus on when we construct **causal structures** to explain some series of events. Causal structure is simply a fancy way of saying that you describe something through a series of causes and effects. When you see some effect and reason about the cause, in the literature, this is known as **inference** - so you **infer** the cause. I will use two examples:
1. Seeing a rolling ball hit a box
2. A funny Facebook post I saw that claimed that the 1970 Super Bowl loss for the Buffalo Bills is the cause for the now astronomic fame of Kim Kardashian.


## Example 1: Rolling Ball hits box
Let's begin with the example of a ball rolling and hitting a box. Should the box move, you might infer that it moved because the ball hit it. Further, you might infer that the ball was heavier than the box or came at it with a relatively large amount of force. If the box didn't move, you might infer that the box was much heavier than the ball or that the ball didn't come with enough force. As you can see, it was fairly easy to decompose this situation to its most relevant components and to reason about their properties and relations. 

*And honestly*, humans achieve **remarkable** performance for far more complex situations. Humans analyze economic and political news to predict the impact on the stock market, we constantly correctly analyze and interpret social interactions, the list really goes on. I think this success partially drives a sense of implicit hubris many of us develop that we can accurately or successfully reason about and explain many complex things in the world. To argue for why this is a slippery slope and why, no matter how confident, we should treat our conclusions as **assessments** and not truths, I will use an example I found on Facebook.

## Example 2: Super Bowl loss leads to Kardashian fame

To explain why Kim Kardashian is famous, the author of this post essentially creates a narrative containing the following causal structure:

![inference]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/posts/misc/buffalo_bills_causal.PNG)

While this is **hilarious**, it relies on some conclusions which *clearly* may not be true. For the sake of argument and to expound my point, I will run through one. The last **inference** made is that Kim was able to gain the fame she did by bootstrapping off of a smaller amount of fame that she "acquired" from her father. Is this true? Maybe. Let's explore some alternatives:

* Kim's father aside, Kim was a frequent in tabloids because of the famous celebrities and athletes that she dated. This might have provided sufficient preliminary fame.
* Kim's mother, Kris Jenner, married Bruce (now Caitlyn) Jenner after divorcing Robert Kardashian. Bruce also held a fair amount of fame which could have potentially given Kim sufficient preliminary fame.
* The sex-tape released was between Kim and R&B star Ray J. Ray J's fame alone might have been enough to propel Kim to fame anyway (potentially under the right marketing).

My point is that this situation is complex and there are a multitude of factors that play a role in the final outcome. When we are making inferences about the outcome, we should be weary of the potential sources of uncertainty. To model this a **little** more precisely, let's use the diagram below where solid lines indicate given knowledge, a dashed lines indicate unknowns. I.e., we know A, B, and that A "leads" to B. But we potentially don't know about the existence of C or about how C leads to B. We'll define
* A as Robert Kardashian becoming somewhat famous, and 
* B as Kim Kardashian leveraging that fame to become more famous via a sex tape.

There are a few things that we don't think about when we make inferences. First, there are other latent, confounding factors (such as C or D) that may exist. Even if we know about the existence of C or D, we may not know about the causal relation they have on B. Put another way, we really don't know if C or D exist or about their impact on B. Additionally, it's hard to measure which components of A and B are shared (e.g. "fame" of Kim), if they differ, and by how much. We don't use precise quantities but **rough** approximations. Finally, the casual relationship we construct (e.g. that between A and B) involves inductive leaps that sway over/ignore many details. This is all to say, **THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY WE SHOULD BE SUSPECT OF OUR CONCLUSIONS AND NOT TREAT THEM AS TRUTH.**

## Conclusions and reflections
![inference]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/posts/misc/buffalo_bills_confounding_long.png)
I think is this is very relevant to our own lives. Imagine that the relationship above isn't simply A leads to B, but A leads to B leads to Z. You don't really know if A led to B, so even if B led to Z (which it might not have), you might mistakenly infer that A ultimately is the reason for Z. 

One of the most important realizations I've come to in my life is that I shouldn't treat my conclusions (especially about complex things like social interactions) as "truth". I'm an anxious, analytical person, so I tend to analyze everything to death. In the past, when I and a romantic partner break up, I tend to think about all the possible causes for this. And, largely, this is so I can learn from the experience and better my self. But it's **very** important, that I treat my conclusions as falsifiable **assessments** instead of truths because what I've learned is that I **really** don't know. 

And this is true for many situations. Why didn't I get that job offer? Why wasn't I accepted into that program? Why did that interview go poorly? We can analyze things to whatever depth we so wish, but it's very difficult to come to conclusions that have high certainty. Don't get me wrong, I think it's important that one **does** analyze these things and try to learn from them to do better in the future. But, ultimately, we need to accept that our conclusions as *potentially* very wrong and treat them that way. This helps in not biasing our future actions negatively and not having them be informed by false information. 

Anyways, I hope you enjoyed reading this and that you found this concluding rant helpful to your own life! Good luck remaining skeptical of your own conclusions. It's a constant fight against your own hubris.

I recently got into a discussion with a friend about personal "truths". She told me it was okay for people to have differing personal truths. I agreed with her but I tried to emphasize that the notion of "truth" should be ascribed to conclusions sparingly.

Understand that we have personal truths like religion. If you're christian, christianity, god, etc. are your truths.

But I think you have to be careful about not treating conclusions you make about the highly complex real world as truths. especially when it comes to making conclusions about the world in terms of cause and effect there are a TON of potentially latent, confounding factors


personal story. I actually came to a realization about this around the time I was a sophomore in college.

Recently, I was analyzing the behavior of a close friend of mine. She seemed to respond aggressively to me when I made sloppy comments.
in my memory, she responded with frustration when I first met her as well
did her responses change? Can I with ANY certainty or accuracy qualify this change?
no I can make a series of sloppy summarizations, inductive leaps, and what seem like deductions
I should NOT treat the output of that as my "truth". 
- summarize reasons


conclusions are uncertain. if you use them as a basis for future conclusions, you're INCREASING the uncertainty. It's like conditioning an estimation with variance on variables with high-variance. (think this through and formulate them mathemaitcally. try to include things like latent factors?). this leads to a vicious cycle.
