TL;DR: One should sparingly ascribe "truth" to the conclusions one makes.

I think it's okay to have a (relatively) small set of core beliefs that you treat as "truth". These can stem from religion, from science, some combination, or something else entirely. But once you begin to analyze the real world and draw conclusions about it from experience, your conclusions should be treated as **assessments** and not as "truths". By this, I mean that often we should consciously recognize and accept that potentially large sources of uncertainty accompany our conclusions. Additionally, often, we should recite the simple disclaimer that we *might* be wrong.

You might disagree. You might say, "Wilka, some things are simple and allow for conclusions to be easily drawn with high confidence." I agree. I believe that the confidence that one should have in a conclusion should tend to fall disproportionately to how complex the corresponding situation is. That is, simple situations tend to correspond to high confidence, whereas complex situations tend to correspond to low confidence.

For the sake of this discussion, I'm going to focus on when we construct **causal structures** to explain some series of events. Causal structure is simply a fancy way of saying that you describe something - the world - through a series of causes and effects. When you see some effect and reason about the cause, in the literature, this is known as **inference** - so you **infer** the cause. I will use two examples:
1. Seeing a ball hit a box and the result
2. A funny Facebook post I saw that claimed that the a Super Bowl loss for the Buffalo Bills was the cause for the now astronomic fame of Kim Kardashian


Let's being with the example of the ball rolling and hitting the box. Should the box move, you might infer that it moved because the ball hit it. Further, you might infer that the ball was heavier than the box or came at it with a relatively large amount of force. If the box didn't move, you might infer that the box was much heavier than the ball or that the ball didn't come with enough force. As you can see, it was fairly easy to decompose this situation to its most relevant components and to reason about their properties and relations. And honestly, humans achieve **remarkable** performance for far more complex situations. Humans analyze economic and political news to predict the impact on the stock market, we constantly correctly analyze and interpret social interactions, etc. I think this ability partially drives a sense of implicit hubris many of us develop that we can accurately or successfully reason about and explain many things that we see in the world.

To argue for why this is a slippery slope and why, no matter how confident, we should treat our conclusions as **assessments** and not truths, I will use an example I found on Facebook.

To explain why Kim Kardashian is famous, the author of this post essentially created a narrative containing the following causal structure:

While this is **hilarious**, it relies on some conclusions which are *clearly* not necessarily true. For the sake of argument and to expound my point, I will run through one. The last point made is that Kim was able to gain the fame she did by bootstrapping off of a smaller amount of fame that she "acquired" from her father. Is this true? Maybe. Let's explore some alternatives:
* Kim's father aside, Kim was a frequent in tabloids because of the famous celebrities and athletes that she dates. This might have provided sufficient preliminary fame.
* Kim's mother, Kris Jenner, married Bruce (now Caitlyn) Jenner after divorcing Robert Kardashian. Bruce also held a fair amount of fame which could have potentially given Kim sufficient preliminary fame.
* The sex-tape released was between Kim and R&B star Ray J. Ray J's fame alone might have been enough to propel Kim to fame anyway (potentially under the right marketing).

My point is that this situation is complex and there are a multitude of factors that play a role in the final outcome. To model this a **little** more precisely, let's use the diagram below and define 
* A as the Robert Kardashian becoming somewhat famous, and 
* B as Kim Kardashian leveraging that fame to become more famous via a sex tape.

There are a few things that we don't think about when we draw conclusions. First, there are other latent, confounding factors (such as C or D) that may exist. Even if we know about the existence of C or D, we may not know about the causal relation they have to our observed effect, B. Put another way, we really don't know if C or D exist or about their impact on B. Additionally, it's hard to measure which components of A and B are shared (e.g. "fame" of Kim), if they differ, and by how much. We don't use precise quantities but **rough** approximations. Finally, the casual relationship we construct (e.g. that between A and B) involves inductive leaps that sway over/ignore many details. This is all to say, THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY WE SHOULD BE SUSPECT OF OUR CONCLUSIONS AND NOT TREAT THEM AS TRUTH.

I recently got into a discussion with a friend about personal "truths". She told me it was okay for people to have differing personal truths. I agreed with her but I tried to emphasize that the notion of "truth" should be ascribed to conclusions sparingly.

Understand that we have personal truths like religion. If you're christian, christianity, god, etc. are your truths.

But I think you have to be careful about not treating conclusions you make about the highly complex real world as truths. especially when it comes to making conclusions about the world in terms of cause and effect there are a TON of potentially latent, confounding factors


personal story. I actually came to a realization about this around the time I was a sophomore in college.

Recently, I was analyzing the behavior of a close friend of mine. She seemed to respond aggressively to me when I made sloppy comments.
in my memory, she responded with frustration when I first met her as well
did her responses change? Can I with ANY certainty or accuracy qualify this change?
no I can make a series of sloppy summarizations, inductive leaps, and what seem like deductions
I should NOT treat the output of that as my "truth". 
- summarize reasons


conclusions are uncertain. if you use them as a basis for future conclusions, you're INCREASING the uncertainty. It's like conditioning an estimation with variance on variables with high-variance. (think this through and formulate them mathemaitcally. try to include things like latent factors?). this leads to a vicious cycle. -->
