<h3>Here is some other fun stuff.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    As part of an <a href="http://biochemnewsletter.com/sbu-wins-1-4-million-nih-grant-to-support-underrepresented-undergrad-and-doctoral-researchers/">initiative to increase minority representation in STEM </a> by combating it at one of its roots: poor math performance, I led a supplemental calculus course at <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/">Stony Brook University</a>. The initiative was started by <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/biochem/research/faculty/gergen/"> Professor Peter Gergen</a> and supported by $1.4 million grant from the <a href="https://www.nih.gov/">National Institutes of Health</a> (NIH). <a href="/files/cie_biomath.pdf">This</a> is an article written about the course.

    <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/happenings/student-spotlight/2015-nsf-graduate-research-fellow-wilka-carvalho/">This</a> is an article written about me at my undergraduate institution when I won the NSF GRF.
  </li>
  <li>
    While at Stony Brook, I was featured as the <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/happenings/homespotlight/ureca-researcher-of-the-month-wilka-carvalho/">Researcher of the Month</a> in December, 2014. 
  </li>
  <li>
    This is a poem I wrote about the brain: <a href="/poem/2013/02/14/brain/">A Physicist Enamored by the Brain.</a> Ironically, it was written on valentines day. <a href="poetry">Here</a> is some other poetry I've written.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEWjrxm2UrA">This</a> is a youtube video I made when I was in 7th grade, which somehow managed to get <strong>15 million </strong> views. Wowza
