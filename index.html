My name is Wilka Torrico De Carvalho. I am a master's student and a <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/"> NSF Graduate Research Fellow</a> in the <a href="http://www.cs.usc.edu">computer science department</a> at the <a href="http://www.usc.edu">University of Southern California</a>, where I am advised by Professor <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~liu32/">Yan Liu</a>. I do research with her on neural networks for topics like transfer learning, domain adaptation, and reinforcement learning. Before this, I recieved a bachelor's of science in physics from <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/">Stony Brook University</a>, where I was advised by <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/nuclear-experiment/personal/axeldrees.html">Axel Drees</a>. I worked with him on computational nuclear physics research <a href="https://github.com/wcarvalho/dirc-detector">modeling a particle detector</a> for heavy-ion collisions.

<br><br>

My primary research interest is in uncovering the brain's algorithms. More specifically, I want to research how behavior and cognition are manifestations of the brainâ€™s learning algorithms and to emulate these algorithms using a machine learning framework.

  <li>
    As part of an <a href="http://biochemnewsletter.com/sbu-wins-1-4-million-nih-grant-to-support-underrepresented-undergrad-and-doctoral-researchers/">initiative to increase minority representation in STEM </a> by combating it at one of its roots: poor math performance, I led a supplemental calculus course at <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/">Stony Brook University</a>. The initiative was started by <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/biochem/research/faculty/gergen/"> Professor Peter Gergen</a> and supported by $1.4 million grant from the <a href="https://www.nih.gov/">National Institutes of Health</a> (NIH). <a href="/files/cie_biomath.pdf">This</a> is an article written about the course.

  <li>
    <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/happenings/student-spotlight/2015-nsf-graduate-research-fellow-wilka-carvalho/">This</a> is an article written about me at my undergraduate institution when I won the NSF GRF.
  </li>
  <li>
    While at Stony Brook, I was featured as the <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/happenings/homespotlight/ureca-researcher-of-the-month-wilka-carvalho/">Researcher of the Month</a> in December, 2014.

    This is a poem I wrote about the brain: <a href="/poem/2013/02/14/brain/">A Physicist Enamored by the Brain.</a> Ironically, it was written on valentines day. <a href="poetry">Here</a> is some other poetry I've written.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEWjrxm2UrA">This</a> is a youtube video I made when I was in 7th grade, which somehow managed to get <strong>15 million </strong> views. Wowza
