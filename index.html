I am a Masters student and a <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/"> Neuroscience NSF Graduate Research Fellow</a> in the <a href="http://www.cs.usc.edu">Computer Science Department</a> at the <a href="http://www.usc.edu">University of Southern California</a>. I work with Professor <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~liu32/">Yan Liu</a>, building deep neural network models. Currently, I am working on a variational adversarial domain adaptation model.
<br><br>

My primary research interest is in understanding the brain as an information-processing system. More specifically, I want to research how behavior and cognition are manifestations of the brainâ€™s learning algorithms and to emulate these algorithms using a machine learning framework.

<h3>Here is some other fun stuff.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    As part of an <a href="http://biochemnewsletter.com/sbu-wins-1-4-million-nih-grant-to-support-underrepresented-undergrad-and-doctoral-researchers/">initiative to increase minority representation in STEM </a> by combating it at one of its roots: poor math performance, I led a supplemental calculus course at <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/">Stony Brook University</a>. The initiative was started by <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/biochem/research/faculty/gergen/"> Professor Peter Gergen</a> and supported by $1.4 million grant from the <a href="https://www.nih.gov/">National Institutes of Health</a> (NIH). <a href="/files/cie_biomath.pdf">This</a> is an article written about the course.

  <li>
    <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/happenings/student-spotlight/2015-nsf-graduate-research-fellow-wilka-carvalho/">This</a> is an article written about me at my undergraduate institution when I won my NSF.
  </li>
  <li>
    While at Stony Brook, I was <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/happenings/homespotlight/ureca-researcher-of-the-month-wilka-carvalho/">Researcher of the Month</a> in December, 2014. 
  </li>
  <li>
    This is a poem I wrote about the brain: <a href="poems/brain_poem/">A Physicist Enamored by the Brain.</a><br>
    Ironically, it was written on valentines day. <a href="poetry">Here</a> is some other poetry I wrote when I was younger.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://youtu.be/VEWjrxm2UrA">This</a> is a youtube video I made when I was in 7th grade, which somehow managed to get <strong>15 million </strong> views. Wowza
